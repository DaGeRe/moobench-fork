MooBench  http://kieker-monitoring.net/MooBench
-----------------------------------------------

This folder contains an example script showing how to include 
MooBench into continuous integration.

The script copies a pre-compiled version of MooBench and the 
jar file to be benchmarked to a given remote server. It executes 
MooBench and retrieves the results. These results can be visualized 
in the web application of the continuous integration server.

We have successfully employed the script on a Jenkins server (v. 1.554)
with the Plot plugin (v. 1.7). The results are availabe under:
* http://build.kieker-monitoring.net/job/kieker-nightly-release/plot/

-----------------------------------------------
The remote server should be provided with Java (>= 1.6) and R (> 3.0).
We recommend to use SSH keys for the access.

The client server should contain a prepared folder with a pre-compiled 
version of MooBench, as created by the build script with the appropriate
build target, e.g., 'build-kieker' for Kieker.

Refer to the Kieker git (http://git.kieker-monitoring.net/kieker.git)
in folder '/examples/OverheadEvaluationMicrobenchmark' for a full example 
of using this script.
